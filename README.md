# Webhooks aka. Callback, No polling, Reverse API, Push

Webhooks allow external services to be notified when certain events happen.


A webhook, on the other hand, allows the provider to send (i.e “push”) data to your application as soon as an event occurs. This is why webhooks are sometimes referred to as “reverse APIs.”

APIs need to pull data from a server periodically to stay up to date, but with webhooks, the server can push this data over to you the instant something happens.
